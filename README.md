# Book Search Engine [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

  ## Description

  The Book Search Engine is a program designed for readers of various intensities to find a book to read and save it to a "read later" list. Upon searching for a book, a user can see multiple editions and their corresponding synopsis that is provided on Google Books. After searching for a book, a user should be presented with a screen similar to this: ![Search page](./docs/assets/search.png)

  After targeting the desired book or edition, if a user is logged in, a user is then able to save it to their list. If a user is not logged in or signed up, a user will be redirected to that form to be able to access saving and deleting books from their saved list. Directing to the Saved books page, a user should be presented with a similar screen: ![Saved books](./docs/assets//saved-books.png`)
  
  This application has been repurposed from a RESTful API to GaqphQL and uses the Google Books API.
